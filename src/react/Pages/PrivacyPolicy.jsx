<h4>Transferring your data outside the "EEA"</h4>
<p>We may transfer your data outside the European Economic Area (the "EEA").</p>
<p>Some of those countries have a European Commission adequacy decision, which means they are considered to offer an adequate level of data protection.</p>
<p>Other countries do not have the same level of legal protection as countries in the EEA, or with an adequacy decision. If we do transfer your data in this way, we will take steps to ensure that it is protected to the same levels that apply in the EEA. This may include, for example, ensuring that the organisation receiving the data is registered with the EU-US Privacy Shield (in the case of transfers to the USA), or that we use the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en" target="_blank">EU'smodel contractual clauses</a> .</p>
<h4>Covered Entities</h4>
<p>Brit Fintech Awards entities and all non- Brit Fintech Awards entities (e.g., agents, contractors, outsource service providers and processors) accessing or processing Personal Data are required to comply with this Policy with respect to such Personal Data.</p>
<h4>
Responsibilities
</h4>
<p>The Data Officer is primarily responsible for adopting, implementing, and maintaining this Policy.</p>
<p>The responsibility for the implementation of the Policy lies with every employee and manager, whether the Personal Data is in the form of manual records, computer data or arises from communication with employees and Data Subjects both online (electronic) or off line (manual records). Implementation requirements will include the development of notice and consent forms to provide to managers and Data Subjects where required by applicable laws.</p>
<p>Employees, agents, contractors and their employees are individually responsible for providing/maintaining accurate information and for protecting the personal information that Brit Fintech Awards has about any individual in support of the implementation of this Policy. Employees who violate this Policy or applicable legal requirements are subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment, dependent on the severity of the violation. Agents or contractors or their employees who violate this Policy or applicable legal requirements are subject to termination and/or other contractual penalties. Employees, agents and contractors should also be aware that if they knowingly or recklessly obtain or divulge Personal Data without Care Insights' consent, they may be committing a criminal offence.</p>
<h4>Data Privacy Investigation and Dispute Resolution</h4>
<p>Human Resources will address any complaints or disputes regarding Personal Data promptly and courteously, and will follow all applicable laws to respond to the complaint. This includes inquiries from Data Subjects, employee councils, management sponsors, or regulatory authorities.</p>
<p>A responsible person designated by management will handle investigations regarding non-compliance with this Policy. All investigations will be handled under the legal requirements of the geographic area where the investigation is taking place.</p>
<h4>Access to Personal Data</h4>
<p>The Data Officer is responsible for maintaining and safeguarding Personal Data, and for ensuring that access to such Personal Data is restricted to persons who have a job-related "need to know" or who have documented access rights. Covered entities may have access to Personal Data on a business related need to know for purposes generally compatible with the collection of the Personal Data.

</p>
<p>Data Subjects may review the contents of any files as requested pursuant to the access principles detailed above and subject to other Brit Fintech Awards policies. All Data Subjects must authenticate themselves based on online or offline standards (i.e., pass codes) set by Brit Fintech Awards before gaining access. Data Subject may request a copy of documents, but under no circumstances will an individual be allowed to remove any documents from the file or be allowed to remove the original file from Care Insights. Certain confidential files, such as investigative files, will not be accessible to Data Subjects, in particular employees.</p>
<h4>Verification of Employment</h4>
<p>Regarding any requests for information concerning an Brit Fintech Awards employee's status which may be received from non- Brit Fintech Awards entities, only members of the human resources department are authorized to release any information and this will be restricted to confirmation of current employment including the employee's name, the most recent job title and the dates of Brit Fintech Awards employment. Additional information will not be provided without the employee's authorization.</p>

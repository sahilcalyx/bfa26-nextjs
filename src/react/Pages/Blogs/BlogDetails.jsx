          <p>
            In the first place we have granted to God, and by this our present
            charter confirmed for us and our heirs forever that the English
            Church shall be free, and shall have her rights entire, and her
            liberties inviolate; and we will that it be thus observed; which
            is apparent from this that the freedom of elections, which is
            reckoned most important and very essential to the English Church,
            we, of our pure and unconstrained will, did grant <br /><br />Pope
            Innocent III, before the quarrel arose between us and our barons:
            and this we will observe, and our will is that it be observed in
            good faith by our heirs forever. We have also granted to all
            freemen of our kingdom, for us and our heirs forever.

          <h4>And Eurypylus, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor</h4>
          <p>
            The son of noble Dolopion, who had been made priest of the river
            Scamander, and was honoured among the people as though he were a
            god. Eurypylus gave him chase as he was flying before him, smote
            him with his sword upon the arm, and lopped his strong hand from
            off it.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              The bloody hand fell to the ground, and the shades of death,
              with fate that no man can withstand, came over his eyes. Thus
              furiously did the battle rage between them. As for the son of
              Tydeus.
            </p>

            He rushed across the plain like a winter torrent that has burst
            its barrier in full flood; no dykes, no walls of fruitful
            vineyards can embank it when it is swollen with rain from heaven
